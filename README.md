System Request

The Street Issue Reporter project was created to help residents quickly report problems such as potholes, broken streetlights, and damaged sidewalks to municipal authorities. Current methods, like phone calls or emails, often cause delays in response and repair times. This system provides a faster and more transparent reporting process through a web-based platform.
Residents can log in, upload images, select a location, and describe the issue. Municipal staff can view, prioritize, and update tickets, while the admin monitors overall performance and escalations. The system improves communication, speeds up issue resolution, and demonstrates realistic municipal workflows for academic learning.

Business Need: Automate and streamline the street issue reporting process.
